    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
    Lovely Bunny's consists of a team of experts with multiple years experience in the bunny breeding, care, and sales industry. We are proud to say that we are official members of the American Rabbit Breeders Association. An organization of high prestige in the Rabbit Breeder and Care Industry.
    </p>
    <p>When we started Lovely Bunny's Rabbitry, our main focus was to educate individuals on these amazing animals, and in turn exemplify how in so many ways they are without doubt the best house pet for all families, even those families located in more densely populated areas, for instance New York City.</p>
    <p>If you cannot make it to us, we have the ability to deliver all throughout the United States, as well as the Tri-State area for an additional fee. Fee's vary by location and are fully disclosed prior to purchase. It is important to note that these bunnies are bred and raised indoor year round. Please do not let them roam on grass at any point. We consistently prioritize the bunny's safety and well being. This varies from exercise on a daily basis to play time for our adult bunnies. When the babies are born they stay with their mother for six weeks. Following, we slowly wean them from their mother for two weeks so that at eight weeks they are ready to go to their Forever Homes.</p>
